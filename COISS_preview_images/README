This script returns image urls to stdout for all jpeg images in a given size for an entire Cassini ISS data volume as found at the NASA PDS Rings Node at http://pds-ring.seti.org. 

All images must be credited to:  NASA/JPL/Space Science Institute.

Provide volume_id as first arg, and optionally image size as second arg. 
Valid sizes = thumb/small/med/full. Default is 'med'

Like so:

python volume_scraper.py COISS_2069 thumb

note that jpegs in all sizes except 'full' produced by the Rings Node are color tinted to indicate filter.

This scraper made without prermission, please use wisely.
